Module 4 Challenge
My answers are in the file called "PyCitySchools_hw.ipynb". I accidently ran cell 30 in the "PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb" and was using it to copy/paste from while doing the challenge.
I split cell 14 from the "PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb" into two cells in my answers as I thought it was easier to see them separately instead of together.
Before I was able to run cell 26 of the "PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb" file, I had to replace the "$" with nothing and then make "Per Student Budget" into a float type 

Findings all referenced cells come from my "PyCitySchools_hw.ipynb" file:
Charter schools have a higher test score average and higher percentage of students passing (scores higher than 70) for both reading and math (see last cell #110)
Although Cabera High School has the highest % Overall passing students, they have a lower student count and lower school budget than Rodriguez High School, the school with the lowest % Overall passing students. (see cells# 75 & 76)
It's interesting that the "Medium" school size have the highest % overall passing students even though the "small" school size have around the same average math and reading scores (see cell #107)
